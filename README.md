# Breast-Cancer-Screening-DBT-on-3D-Dicom-images-using-deep-learning-techniques
Breast cancer remains a critical global health concern, demanding advancements in screening methods to improve early detection and patient outcomes. This study explores the integration of deep learning techniques with Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) on 3D DICOM images to revolutionize breast cancer screening. Motivation stems from the potential synergy between deep learning's pattern recognition capabilities and DBT's comprehensive breast tissue imaging. By leveraging the Detectron2 framework with Faster R-CNN, DCNN and YOLO v8 for moduledetection, we automate the process of distinguishing benign from cancerous lesions within breastimages. This collaborative approach aims to reduce the burden of manual interpretation, allowingmedical professionals to focus on challenging cases. The ultimate goal is to enhance patient outcomes by increasing diagnostic accuracy and reducing false positives in breast cancer screening. The results of our research demonstrate the promising potential of deep learning inconjunction with DBT, paving the way for a more efficient and precise breast cancer screeningprocess. This innovation holds the promise of transforming the field of breast cancer diagnosis, bringing us closer to earlier detection and improved patient care.
